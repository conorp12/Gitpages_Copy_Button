# Gitpages Copy Button
A repo to try to figure out how to add a copy button to code snippets on GitPages. 
On github when using code snippet blocks there is automatically a copy button added.
```sh
Example: code snippet
```
However when this converted to Gitpages this feature dissapears giving rise to the aims of 
this repo.
# Goals
1. Add functional Copy Button.
2. Format Copy Button.
3. Make it deployable on any Gitpages website. 

Following the tutorial found [here](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/how-to-add-a-copy-to-clipboard-button-to-your-jekyll-blog/) this is the result.
